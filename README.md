A proud and ambitious teen who isnâ€™t afraid to stand out. Iâ€™m a physics nerd who loves coding, robotics, and pushing technology to its limits. Gaming is for fun, but studying is for the future I know Iâ€™ll conquer. Aiming to become a pilot or engineer, I lead with confidence and build with passion.
